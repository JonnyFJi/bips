== Introduction ==

=== Abstract ===

This document proposes a new SegWit output type, with spending rules based initially-- but not solely-- upon FALCON signatures. (For more on why, see the Rationale and Security sections.) A constraint is that no hard fork or increase in block size are necessary. This document is inspired by [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki BIP-341], which introduced the design of the P2TR (Taproot) address type using Schnorr signatures.

=== Motivation ===

This proposal aims to improve the quantum resistance of bitcoin's signature security should the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) which secures Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) no longer prove to be computationally hard, likely through quantum advantage by Cryptographically-Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs). [https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0301141 A variant of Shor's algorithm] is believed to be capable of deriving the private key from a public key exponentially faster than classical means. The application of this variant of Shor's algorithm is herein referred to as quantum key decryption. Note that doubling the public key length, such as with a hypothetical secp512k1 curve, would only make deriving the private key twice as hard. The computational complexity of this is investigated further in the paper, [https://pubs.aip.org/avs/aqs/article/4/1/013801/2835275/The-impact-of-hardware-specifications-on-reaching ''The impact of hardware specifications on reaching quantum advantage in the fault tolerant regime''].

Mining may one day be vulnerable to disruption by very advanced quantum computers making use of Grover's algorithm. However, Grover's [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.02332 scales very poorly] compared to Shor's, requiring 10^40 quantum operations in comparison to 10^8 for running Shor's over ECC. It's for this reason that the primary threat to Bitcoin by quantum computers is to its signature algorithm and not Proof of Work, hence the focus on a new address format.

The vulnerability of existing bitcoin addresses is investigated in [https://web.archive.org/web/20240715101040/https://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/innovatie/artikelen/quantum-computers-and-the-bitcoin-blockchain.html this Deloitte report]. The report estimates that in 2020 approximately 25% of the bitcoin supply is held within addresses vulnerable to quantum attack.

Ordinarily, when a transaction is signed, the public key can be recovered from the signature. This makes a transaction submitted to the mempool vulnerable to quantum attack until it's mined. One way to mitigate this is to submit the transaction directly to a mining pool, which bypasses the mempool. This process is known as an out-of-band transaction. The mining pool must be trusted not to reveal the key to attackers.

It is proposed to implement a Pay to Quantum Resistant Hash (P2QRH) address type that relies on a post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) signature algorithm. This new address type protects transactions submitted to the mempool and helps preserve the free market by reducing the need for private, out-of-band mempool transactions.

The following table is non-exhaustive, but meant to inform the average bitcoin user whether their bitcoin is vulnerable to quantum attack.

It should be noted that Taproot addresses are vulnerable in that they encode a 32-byte x-only public key, from which a full public key can be reconstructed.

Should quantum advantage manifest, a convention is proposed in spending the full 65-byte P2PK key used by the coinbase output in Block 1 back to itself. It is proposed to call this the [https://mempool.space/address/0496b538e853519c726a2c91e61ec11600ae1390813a627c66fb8be7947be63c52da7589379515d4e0a604f8141781e62294721166bf621e73a82cbf2342c858ee Canary address]. The reasoning behind this is that this can only be done by Satoshi, and given his absence, this can only be spent by others if there is a significant vulnerability in secp256k1. Should the Canary coins move, that will signal that bitcoin is presently vulnerable. Without the Canary, or an address like it, there may be some doubt as to whether the coins were moved with keys belonging to the original owner.

As an interesting aside, coinbase outputs to P2PK keys go as far as block 200,000, so it's possible there are between 1-2 million coins that are vulnerable from the first epoch. These coins can be considered "Satoshi's Shield." Any addresses with a balance of less than the original block subsidy of 50 coins can be considered incentive incompatible to capture until all of these are mined.

It's for this reason that, for those who wish to be prepared for quantum emergency, it is recommended that no more than 50 bitcoin are kept under a single distinct, unused Native SegWit (P2WPKH, "bc1q") address at a time. This is assuming that the attacker is financially-motivated instead of, for example, a nation state looking to break confidence in Bitcoin. Additionally, this assumes that other vulnerable targets such as central banks have upgraded their cryptography already.

The Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite (CNSA) 2.0 has a timeline for software and networking equipment to be upgraded by 2030, with browsers and operating systems fully upgraded by 2033.

Lastly, it is worth noting by way of comparison that [https://ethresear.ch/t/how-to-hard-fork-to-save-most-users-funds-in-a-quantum-emergency/18901 Vitalik Buterin's proposed solution] in an Ethereum quantum emergency is quite different from the approach in this BIP. His plan involves a hard fork of the chain, reverting all blocks after a sufficient amount of theft, and using STARKs based on BIP-32 seeds to act as the authoritative secret when signing. These measures are deemed far too heavy-handed for bitcoin.


=== Rationale ===

This is the first in a series of BIPs under a QuBit soft fork. A qubit is a fundamental unit of quantum computing, and the capital B represents its connection to bitcoin. The name QuBit also rhymes to some extent with SegWit.

It is proposed to use SegWit version 3. This results in addresses that start with bc1r, which could be a useful way to remember that these are [r]esistant addresses, similar to how bc1q corresponds to Se[q]Wit and bc1p corresponds to Ta[p]root. This is referencing the lookup table under [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki#bech32 BIP-173].

The proposal above also leaves a gap in case it makes sense to use version 2, or bc1z, for implementation of other address formats such as those that employ Cross Input Signature Aggregation (CISA).

P2QRH is meant to be implemented on top of P2TR, combining the security of classical Schnorr signatures along with post-quantum cryptography. This is a form of "hybrid cryptography" such that no regression in security is presented should a vulnerability exist in one of the signature algorithms used. One key distinction between P2QRH and P2TR however is that P2QRH will encode a hash of the public key. This is a significant change in how Taproot works, but is necessary to avoid exposing public keys on-chain in advance of attackers.

P2QRH uses a 32-byte HASH256 (specifically SHA-256 twice-over, which is similar to that used in [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki#specification BIP-16]) of the public key to reduce the size of new outputs and also to increase security by not having the public key available on-chain. This hash serves as a minimal cryptographic commitment to a public key. It goes into the output spend script, which does not receive the witness discount.

Not having public keys exposed on-chain is an important step for quantum security. Otherwise funds would need to be spent to new addresses on a regular basis in order to prevent the possibility of a "long-range CRQC attack" recovering the key behind high value addresses. A long-range quantum attack can be considered one performed with chain data, such as that from a used address or one encoded in a spend script. A "short-range quantum attack" would be one done on keys in the mempool, which is seen as impractical given transaction throughput and block time. As the value being sent increases, so too should the fee in order to commit the transaction to the chain as soon as possible.  This makes useless the public key revealed by spending a UTXO, so long as it is never reused.

Post-quantum public keys are generally larger than those used by ECC, depending on the security level. To promote user adoption and general user-friendliness, the most secure variant (NIST V, 256 bit) is proposed, despite the increase in key length and verification time.

Support for FALCON signatures will be introduced first, with the intention of adding SQIsign and other post-quantum algorithms as they are approved. By way of comparison, FALCON signatures are roughly 4x larger than SQIsign signatures and 20x larger than Schnorr signatures. FALCON is a more conservative approach to applied lattice cryptography than SQIsign, and its use has recently been approved by NIST. NIST approval streamlines implementations through establishing consensus in the scientific and developer community. However, even SQIsign signatures are roughly 5x larger than Schnorr signatures. This means, to maintain present transaction throughput, an increase in the witness discount will likely be desired in a QuBit soft fork. That will be specified in a future QuBit BIP.

An increase in the witness discount must not be taken lightly.  It must be resistant to applications that might take advantage of this discount (e.g. storage of arbitrary data as seen with "inscriptions") without a corresponding increase in economic activity. Such an increase would not only impact node runners but those with inscriptions would also have the scarcity of their non-monetary assets affected. The only way to prevent this while also increasing the discount is to have a completely separate witness, a quantum witness, or "quitness," that is solely responsible for providing post-quantum signatures.

To address the risk of arbitrary data being stored using P2QRH (QuBit) addresses, very specific rules will be applied to spending from the witness stack in SegWit v3 outputs. A fixed signature size will be necessary for spending the output, and the output must be spendable to be considered valid within node consensus. A fixed signature size will also be helpful to disambiguate between signature types without an additional version byte, as SQIsign signatures are substantially smaller than FALCON signatures. Consequently, the correct signature algorithm can be inferred through byte length. The public key and signature will be pushed separately to the quitness stack. Multiple signatures can be included in order to support multisig applications, and also for spending multiple inputs.

Since only valid signatures can be committed to in a SegWit v3 quitness, arbitrary data cannot be added by miners, as that would affect the consensus of their block. A CRQC operator is economically disincentivized from computing a spendable public key that matched arbitrary signature data due to the cost of that computation. That is because the cost of such a computation could prove quite substantial, rather than simply putting the arbitrary data within a Taproot witness. Doing the work to meet the requirement for it to be consensus-valid data would prove cost-prohibitive.

Additionally, it should be noted, whether an output with a P2QRH spend script corresponds to a FALCON or SQIsign signature is not known until the output is spent.

While it might be seen as a maintenance burden for bitcoin ecosystem devs to go from a single cryptosystem implementation to two distinct cryptosystems-- and it most certainly is-- the ramifications of a chain broken through extrinsic factors should provide sufficient motivation. An increase in software maintenance everywhere signatures are used should be seen as an acceptable compromise for maintained integrity of bitcoin transfers during a regime of quantum advantage.

In the distant future, following the implementation of the P2QRH address format in a QuBit soft fork, there will likely be a need for Pay to Quantum Secure (P2QS) addresses. These will require specialized quantum hardware for signing, while still [https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2023-01-19-901/ using public keys that are verifiable via classical means]. Additional follow-on BIPs will be needed to implement P2QS. However, until specialized quantum cryptography hardware is widespread, quantum resistant addresses should be an adequate intermediate solution.


== Description ==

We first build up a definition of the signature scheme by going through the design choices. Afterwards, we specify the exact encodings and operations.


=== Design ===

For P2QRH descriptors, <code>qrh()</code> should be used.

As shown, supersingular elliptic curve quaternion isogeny signature algorithms represent the state of the art in post-quantum cryptography, beyond lattice cryptography alone, especially when key and signature length are major constraints. This makes inclusion of SQIsign attractive, and support is planned, but it will be some time until it is approved for production use. Meanwhile, FALCON signatures are already approved and have achieved broader community consensus.

In comparison, the size of currently used signature algorithms are:

* ECDSA - 70-72 bytes
* Schnorr - 64 bytes

In comparison to year, secp256k1 [https://www.secg.org/SEC1-Ver-1.0.pdf was originally specified in 2000].

One consideration for choosing an algorithm is its maturity. secp256k1 was already 8 years old by the time it was chosen as bitcoin's curve. Isogeny cryptography when it was first introduced was broken over a weekend.

Ideally SQIsign also proves to be flexible enough to support [https://www.pierrickdartois.fr/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Report_OSIDH_DARTOIS.pdf Isogeny Diffie-Hellman] to replace ECDH applications, and also provide methods for the key tweaking necessary to support TapScript for P2QR addresses. Additionally, isogeny-based post-quantum cryptography is based on higher-order elliptic curves, and so it might be possible to implement Isogeny Schnorr signatures.

Signature verification speed as it compares to Schnorr or ECDSA isn't seen as high a consideration as signature size due to block space being the primary fee constraint. As a P2QRH implementation materializes, a benchmark will be added for performance comparison. Fortunately, SQIsign signatures are substantially faster to verify than it is to generate keys or to sign, which is a major consideration when a transaction need only be signed once, or a handful of times with PSBT, compared to being verified simultaneously on tens of thousands of nodes. Key generation may need to cached in [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki BIP-32 HD wallets].

An additional consideration is security levels. Longer signature sizes provide more security. NIST has standardized five security levels for post-quantum cryptography. NIST security level I provides security equivalent to 128-bit keys, and security level V provides 256-bit security.


== Specification ==

How the quitness is differentiated from the witness can be accomplished similar to how [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#user-content-Transaction_ID BIP-141] introduced the marker and flag, with the QuBit flag being set to 0x02. This means all QuBit transactions are also SegWit transactions. The additional data would be included as a second array of byte arrays following the witness stack.

The new transaction serialization format would be as follows:

  [nVersion][marker][flag][txins][txouts][witness][quitness][nLockTime]
